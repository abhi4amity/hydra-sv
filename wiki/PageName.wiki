|| _Read-pair_ || A DNA molecule where a small portion (typically <= 100bp) of the 5' ends have been sequenced, but the entire molecule has not. ||
|| _Concordant_ || A _concordant_ read-pair is aligned to the reference genome with the expected distance and orientation. ||
|| _Discordant_ || A _discordant_ read-pair is *not* aligned to the reference genome with the expected distance and orientation. Clusters of discordant mappings suggest putative SV. ||
|| _PEM_ || Paired-end mapping.  The alignment of each end of a read-pair. ||
