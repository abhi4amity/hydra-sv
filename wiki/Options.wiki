#summary Command line options for Hydra.


*Usage*:   hydra [OPTIONS] -in <mappings> -out <breakpoints> -mld <bp> -mno <bp>

Options:
  -in	File of discordant mappings.
  -out	Stub for output files.
  -mld	Maximum allowable length difference b/w mappings.
  	Typically set to 10 * m.a.d. of the DNA fragment libraries.
  	see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_absolute_deviation

  -mno	Maximum allowable non-overlap b/w mappings.
  	Typically set to median + (20 * m.a.d.) of the DNA fragment libraries.

  -ms	Minimum number of pairs required for variant to be called.
	Default: 2

  -lnk	Maximum intrachromosomal distance allowed before a
  	variant is considered to be between unlinked DNA segments.
  	Default: 1000000 (i.e., 1Mb)

  -is	Choose most likely variant (when a tie exists) based on
  	least edit distance rather than size.

  -li	Combine +/+ and -/- mappings when screening for inversions.
  	This increases sensitivity in low coverage.

  -use	Which mappings should be used for each pair?
  	"best"	Use the mappings with the least edit distance for each pair.
  		Default.
  	"all"	Use all mappings for each pair.
  	<INT>	Use the best plus those within <INT> edit distance of best.
